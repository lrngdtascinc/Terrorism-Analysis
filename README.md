# Terrorism-Analysis

## Why?
#### The purpose of this analysis is to put myself in the mindset of a defense analyst, and to keep my data skills sharp. In this project I will observe certain patterns behind terrorist attacks, ranging from the years 1970 to 2017 to get a better understanding of the nature of certain attacks in an attempt to better combat the global war on terror.

## Deliverables
## 1.) How has the number of terrorist activities changed over the years? Are there certain regions where this trend is different from the global averages?
##
##
## 2.) What are the most common methods of attacks? Does it differ in various regions or in time?
##
##
## 3.) Plot the locations of attacks on a map to visualize their regional spread.
